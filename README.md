非常抱歉，由于本人水平十分有限，我未能完成此次区块链课程的大作业的所有部分。
在经过长时间的自学和试验后，我仅仅完成了智能合约部分的代码。此代码的函数包括创建NFT、开始拍卖、结束拍卖、加价、转移所有权等操作。经过试验，此段代码可以成功通过编译，但是我并不知道如何使其运行。
此外，由于前后端开发知识的匮乏，我未能够完成其余部分以将其串联成整体。此段代码是我尽力所为，非常感谢您的理解。

I'm very sorry that due to my limited level, I failed to complete all parts of the big assignment of this blockchain course.
After a long time of self-study and experiment, I only completed the code of smart contract. The functions of this code include creating NFT, starting auction, ending auction, increasing price, transferring ownership, etc. After testing, this code can be compiled successfully, but I don't know how to make it run.
In addition, due to the lack of front-end and back-end development knowledge, I was unable to complete the rest to connect them as a whole. This code is what I try my best. Thank you very much for your understanding.
